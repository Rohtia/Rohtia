- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rohtia. You can also call me Raine (she/her).
- 👀 I’m interested in changing careers (well, actually finally *getting* a career instead of just a job), so here I am. I am also a fiber arts crafter; I knit and crochet quite a bit, and have recently learned how to cross stitch. I can sew fairly well, but I don't have the room at the moment to really do much in that regard. Probably my favourite hobby is ttrpgs. I have played 10 different systems so far this year, 8 of them were new to me.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, html, and CSS. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something simple? I only began my coding journey on 17 September 2021, and I'm learning this all on my own with free online resources, but I'm hoping to get my first job in the industry in a year.
- 📫 How to reach me: Comments here, discord @Rohtia#1765, or if I can ever figure out how Slack works, there.
